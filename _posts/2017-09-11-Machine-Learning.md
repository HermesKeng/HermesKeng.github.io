- **What is Machine Learning ?**
    - Machine Learning is a field of study that give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
    - Given the dataset(D), we can design the algorithm(A) through the data of dataset to let machine learn from data. After completing the algorithm , we can give an input(I), and create a suitable output(O) by algorithm which is predicted data.

- **What is Machine Learning shine for ?**

    A : There are four things Machine Learning shine 

    1. Getting insignts about complex problems and large amount of data
    2. Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules
    3. Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach
    4. Fluctuating environments

- **Types of Machine Learning System** 
    - Whether or not they are trained **with human supervison**
    - Whether or not they can **learn incrementally on the fly**
    - Whether they work by simply **comparing new data points to known data points or instead detect patterns in ther training data and build a predictive modal**

- **Supervised / Unsupervised Learning** 
    There are four major categories in Supervised / Unsupervised Learning 
    
    **1. Supervised Learning 
     2. Unsupervised Learning
     3. Semisupervised Learning 
     4. Reinforcement Learning**

    - **Supervised Learning**
     The Training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called ==labels==
        1. The two most common in supervised learning
 
            - Classification
            - Target numeric value
        :::info
         Important Supervised Learning Algorithm
         
        -  k- Nearest Neighbors
        -  Linear Regression
        -  Logistic Regression
        -  Support Vector Machines (SVMS)
        -  Decision Trees and Random Forests
        -  Neural networks
        :::
    - **Unsupervised Learning**
    
         The training data is unlabeled 
     
        1. Four common unsupervised task 

            **- Classification**
            **- Visualization** 
            **- Dimensionality Reduction :** the goal is to simplify the data ,and merge serveral correlated features into one. This is called feature extraction
            **- Anomaly detection :** detect whether the data is abnormal and futherer than original clustering 

    - **Semisupervised Learning**
    
     Some algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data.
         - Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combination of unsupervised and supervised algorithms
     
    - **Reinforcement Learning** 
    
     Learn by itself what is best strtegy, called a ==policy==, to get the most ==reward== over time 
         - Learning from mistakes and memory what is good or bad
