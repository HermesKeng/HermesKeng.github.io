- Introduction:

    Rss,called "really simple syndictation" in full, is used to provide subscribers with new content in latest news or message. 
- Why do we need **RSS** ?

    Before, if you want to get the latest news which you usually visit, you have to search the website from the searching engine. After launching Rss, you could use it to automatically access the latest news or blog post from the website by Rss reader. You can find your favorite news, then store their **rss link** (like normal web link we see) and get the updated news automatically from the reader. It also can save us some times on finding the website.
